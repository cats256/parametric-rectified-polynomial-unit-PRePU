Introducing Parametric Rectified Power Unit, a variant of ReLU, an activation that offers superior polynomial approximation while maintaining non-linearity

Author: Nhat Bui (please credit me if your research involves this activation function, would be very helpful since I'm still a student)

PS: Haven't done too much research into this so please forgive me if this activation function has been introduced before but I'm 90% sure if hasn't XD
